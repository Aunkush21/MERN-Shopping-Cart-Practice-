A simple MERN Stack application that I have built using the fundamentals knowledge that I laerned in University :)
Since the exams are over, so the knowledge is still very fresh, therefore i put them into practical use here
The UI is not that great but a lot is going on behind the scenes,
For database MongoDB Atlas is used :)
